# Approach 1
```
def doubleL(n):
    res = [] 
    for i in range(n): res.append(i * 2) 
    return res
```
In this approach the function `double(n)` creates a list of numbers from `0` to `n-1` and each of them multiplied by 2 and the function returns the list. The for loop prints each of the element returned by doubleL(n) seperated by :.

# Approach 2
```
for x in [n * 2 for n in range(5)]:
    print(x, end=' : ')
```
In this approach it creates a list of numbers from 0 to 4 and each number is doubled then printed in the list. and a `:` is also being placed after each number.

# Approach 3
```
def doubleG(n):
        for i in range(n):
            yield i * 2

for i in doubleG(5):
        print(i, end=' : 
```
This method creates a special type of function called a generator function named `doubleG(n)`. This function gives number 0 to less than n and each number is doubled. After that it prints each number ig gets froom `doubleG(n)` and puts a `:` after each number.
